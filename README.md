## 🌐 Usage Instructions

Once you have installed the tool, you can start by following these steps:

1. Open your Python environment (this could be Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda, or any IDE of your choice).
2. Import the necessary libraries including sklearn-selector-pipeline using the command:
   ```python
   import sklearn_selector_pipeline
   ```
3. Load your dataset. Ensure your dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV).
4. Use the provided functions to select features and apply classifiers or regressors.

The documentation within the library will guide you on using each function effectively. 

## 📝 Example Workflow

Here’s a basic example to illustrate how you can use the sklearn-selector-pipeline in a workflow:

```python
from sklearn_selector_pipeline import SomeEstimator
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load example data
data = load_iris()
X, y = data.data, data.target

# Create an instance of your pipeline
pipeline = SomeEstimator()

# Fit the model
pipeline.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = pipeline.predict(X)
```

This sample displays the simple steps needed to create a pipeline that fits a model to your data and makes predictions.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you face any issues during download or installation, check the following:

1. **Correct Python Version**: Ensure you are using Python 3.6 or higher.
2. **Dependency Management**: Use pip to install required dependencies if installation fails:
